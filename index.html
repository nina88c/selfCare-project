        Self-care activities can certainly be considered a hobby. Engaging in self-care is a way of taking care of oneself and can involve a variety of different activities, such as meditation, yoga, journaling, taking a relaxing bath, going for a walk in nature, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in a favorite hobby or leisure activity. By making self-care a regular part of one's routine, it can help reduce stress, improve well-being, and promote overall health. So, while it is not a traditional hobby, self-care can still be considered a form of hobby that is focused on personal growth, relaxation, and self-improvement.
